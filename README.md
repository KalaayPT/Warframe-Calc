# Warframe-Calc

This project is intended to work as a calculator to determine best builds for Archguns to use on the Profit-Taker boss in Warframe.

It has both "damage calc" and "best build" modes, wherein the latter determines the best possible build from all combinations given the arguments and the former just calculates damage based on a mod input.

This project is intended for Profit-Taker calculations, but is written in a way to be modular and expandable for things like Eidolon calculations.

All of the relevant code is found inside calc.py. The rest are just dictionaries to reduce clutter.
